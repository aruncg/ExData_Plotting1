This is the submission for the first course project of the exploratory data analysis course of the data science specialization on coursera.

It has 4 R scripts - plot`n`.R, where plot`n`.R produces plot`n`.png for n = 1,2,3,4.

It requires `household_power_consumption.txt` to be present in the directory of the R files.
